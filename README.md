# GradeCalculator
A simple grade calculator for a university course with a GUI. 
The grade components are Assignments, Labs, and Exams; these all inherit from Task objects. 
The user can input the weights for each category as well as an overall curve. Tasks can be added and removed.  
Additionally, the user can save to a .txt file in the working directory or chose to clear all  elements and 
start over from scratch.
